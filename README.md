# Product-Landing-Page
This is a responsive product landing page created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this project is to practice front-end development and demonstrate how a typical product website layout is built using web technologies.
How It Works
HTML (index.html)
Uses semantic HTML tags like <header>, <section>, <form>, <footer>.
Includes a headline, product description, image, buy button, and a newsletter signup form.
The form uses input types like text, email, and submit.
CSS (style.css)
Layout is styled using the CSS Box Model, Flexbox, and Media Queries.
Styling includes:
Centered content
Hover effects (e.g., zoom effect on buttons/images)
Mobile responsiveness using @media queries
Consistent margins, padding, borders
